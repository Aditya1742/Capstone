Learning Management System (Capstone Project)

This project is my capstone work where I created a simple Learning Management System using HTML and CSS. The main webpage acts as a central access point where users can navigate to different sections or domains of the system, such as courses, assignments, or profiles.

Key Features:

Frontend designed with HTML and CSS

User-friendly layout and easy navigation

Homepage serves as the main hub to access other parts of the system


Future Improvements:

Add interactivity using JavaScript

Connect to a backend for full functionality like user login and course data
